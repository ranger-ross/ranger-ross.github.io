The utopic vision of AI automating all aspects of the development lifecycle is quickly eroding. There are a wide variety of views on this and I of course have my own. But I have been struggling to come up with a way to articulate my thoughts on where I think the future of AI in software development is going until earlier this week.<p>I believe that AI will have a similar impact on the software industry as Docker and containers did in the 2010s. I’d like to make the case that AI <strong>will</strong> have a large impact on software industry but not as large some may believe.<h2 id=why-containers>Why containers?</h2><p>The idea of containers has been around for a long time but really took off in the mid-2010s with the introduction of Docker which adds nice ideas like images and layering. These concepts made working with containers much easier and the trend of using containers exploded. Fast forward to the 2020s and most modern systems are deployed using containers.<p>Containers changed the way we deploy and distribute our applications. Containers allowed you to deploy without the worry of if the server you deploy to had the correct dependencies installed. This portability was a game changer for complex applications, especially during the rise of cloud computing. Containers also made it very easy to distribute applications and tools with others. It’s fairly common to spin up a database using docker during development with a single <code>docker compose up</code> command.<p>My point here is that containers undoubtly changed the way we write and develop software. My claim is that AI will have a similar level impact but in different ways.<h2 id=agents-and-false-dreams>Agents and false dreams</h2><p>For the past 2 years, there has been a huge push to operationalize AI agents. The idea behind an agent is that it is autonomous and does not require continual input from a human. This frees up the human to do other more important work (or allows the companies replace them if you are cynical).<p>The deployment of agents has been mixed thus far. There are sparks of brilliance with a lot of mediocre results in between. The fundamental issue that has emerged is AI is not reliable on non-trivial problems in real codebases. This is really bad for those that have the vision of replacing humans with agents because until they are reliable a human is needed to double check their work. AI reliability is not likely to dramatically improve without a fundamental reachitecture.<p>The latest trend I have seen is the idea that a human operator will orchestrate many AI agents. A small army of AI agents would process in parallel and the human would verify and course correct as needed. Having the AI do segments of work in the background would theoretically still be a productity win even if limited to the review speed of a single human. I think there is some reasonable application here but we are limited by the cognative load of the human operator. I don’t see a world where we are scale pass 3-5 agents per human on any non-trivial problems. There are just too many code changes for a human to reasonably be able to keep in their head and think about the edge cases where the AI may be doing something wrong.<p>Agents may work in some limited areas but we are nowhere near a general purpose AI agent for for software development.<h2 id=a-more-realistic-impact>A more realistic impact</h2><p>AI is going to be a <strong>tool</strong> for engineers just like containers. I believe the future is going to largely dominated by high focused AI tools that accompish a very specific task in the development lifecycle. Similar to when containers were introduced, the overall approach we take to develop software will not change but the tools will. I believe the true advantage of AI is to get small frequent wins that add up overtime instead of trying to have an AI do large higher level tasks.<p>In fact, I think a large amount of these tools are already available to us.<ul><li>GitHub Copilot (not the agent) provides a AI autocomplete. This is generally focused to a single function making the possible number of mistakes smaller and being low overhead of a human to review and iterate on.<li>Using AI to review human created work (in fact I used ChatGPT to review this blog post)<li>Using AI to orient yourself when working on a unfamiliar problem. Its great to get a rough overview a of problem space and learn some terminology so that you can refine your Google searches to find trust worthy sources.</ul><p>The important thing to note is that the high level functions of software development are not going anywhere. Software engineering, engineering/project management, and designer roles will still exist. There will still need to be planning, development, testing, etc. Each of these roles and processes will likely change in some ways (hopefully for the better) but the overall software process will largely remain unchanged, just like when containers became popular in the 2010s.</section></article></main><div id=button-container><div id=toc-floating-container><input class=toggle id=toc-toggle type=checkbox><label class=overlay for=toc-toggle></label><label title="Toggle Table of Contents" class=button for=toc-toggle id=toc-button><svg viewbox="0 -960 960 960" xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg><path d="M414.82-193.094q-18.044 0-30.497-12.32-12.453-12.319-12.453-30.036t12.453-30.086q12.453-12.37 30.497-12.37h392.767q17.237 0 29.927 12.487 12.69 12.486 12.69 30.203 0 17.716-12.69 29.919t-29.927 12.203H414.82Zm0-244.833q-18.044 0-30.497-12.487Q371.87-462.9 371.87-480.45t12.453-29.92q12.453-12.369 30.497-12.369h392.767q17.237 0 29.927 12.511 12.69 12.512 12.69 29.845 0 17.716-12.69 30.086-12.69 12.37-29.927 12.37H414.82Zm0-245.167q-18.044 0-30.497-12.32t-12.453-30.037q0-17.716 12.453-30.086 12.453-12.369 30.497-12.369h392.767q17.237 0 29.927 12.486 12.69 12.487 12.69 30.203 0 17.717-12.69 29.92-12.69 12.203-29.927 12.203H414.82ZM189.379-156.681q-32.652 0-55.878-22.829t-23.226-55.731q0-32.549 23.15-55.647 23.151-23.097 55.95-23.097 32.799 0 55.313 23.484 22.515 23.484 22.515 56.246 0 32.212-22.861 54.893-22.861 22.681-54.963 22.681Zm0-245.167q-32.652 0-55.878-23.134-23.226-23.135-23.226-55.623 0-32.487 23.467-55.517t56.12-23.03q32.102 0 54.721 23.288 22.62 23.288 22.62 55.775 0 32.488-22.861 55.364-22.861 22.877-54.963 22.877Zm-.82-244.833q-32.224 0-55.254-23.288-23.03-23.289-23.03-55.623 0-32.333 23.271-55.364 23.272-23.03 55.495-23.03 32.224 0 55.193 23.288 22.969 23.289 22.969 55.622 0 32.334-23.21 55.364-23.21 23.031-55.434 23.031Z"/></svg></label><div class=toc-content><div class=toc-container><ul><li><a href=https://ranger-ross.github.io/blog/ai-are-like-containers/#why-containers>Why containers?</a><li><a href=https://ranger-ross.github.io/blog/ai-are-like-containers/#agents-and-false-dreams>Agents and false dreams</a><li><a href=https://ranger-ross.github.io/blog/ai-are-like-containers/#a-more-realistic-impact>A more realistic impact</a></ul></div></div></div><a title="Go to the top of the page" class=no-hover-padding href=# id=top-button> <svg viewbox="0 0 20 20" fill=currentColor><path d="M3.293 9.707a1 1 0 010-1.414l6-6a1 1 0 011.414 0l6 6a1 1 0 01-1.414 1.414L11 5.414V17a1 1 0 11-2 0V5.414L4.707 9.707a1 1 0 01-1.414 0z"/></svg> </a></div><span class=hidden id=copy-success> Copied! </span><span class=hidden id=copy-init> Copy code to clipboard </span><script defer src=https://ranger-ross.github.io/js/copyCodeToClipboard.min.js></script></div><footer><section><nav class="socials nav-navs"><ul><li><a class="nav-links no-hover-padding social" href=https://ranger-ross.github.io/atom.xml> <img alt=feed loading=lazy src=https://ranger-ross.github.io/social_icons/rss.svg title=feed> </a><li><a class="nav-links no-hover-padding social" rel=" me" href=https://github.com/ranger-ross/> <img alt=github loading=lazy src=https://ranger-ross.github.io/social_icons/github.svg title=github> </a><li><a class="nav-links no-hover-padding social" rel=" me" href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/ross-sullivan-a17568135/> <img alt=linkedin loading=lazy src=https://ranger-ross.github.io/social_icons/linkedin.svg title=linkedin> </a></ul></nav><nav class=nav-navs></nav><div class=credits><small> </small></div></section><div class="search-modal js" aria-labelledby=modalTitle id=searchModal role=dialog><h1 class=visually-hidden id=modalTitle>Search</h1><div id=modal-content><div id=searchBar><div aria-hidden=true class=search-icon><svg viewbox="0 -960 960 960" xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg><path d="M784-120 532-372q-30 24-69 38t-83 14q-109 0-184.5-75.5T120-580q0-109 75.5-184.5T380-840q109 0 184.5 75.5T640-580q0 44-14 83t-38 69l252 252-56 56ZM380-400q75 0 127.5-52.5T560-580q0-75-52.5-127.5T380-760q-75 0-127.5 52.5T200-580q0 75 52.5 127.5T380-400Z"/></svg></div><input aria-controls=results-container aria-expanded=false autocomplete=off id=searchInput placeholder=Search… role=combobox spellcheck=false><div class="close-icon interactive-icon" title="Clear search" id=clear-search role=button tabindex=0><svg viewbox="0 -960 960 960" xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg><path d="m256-200-56-56 224-224-224-224 56-56 224 224 224-224 56 56-224 224 224 224-56 56-224-224-224 224Z"/></svg></div></div><div id=results-container><div id=results-info><span id=zero_results> No results</span><span id=one_results> $NUMBER result</span><span id=many_results> $NUMBER results</span><span id=two_results> $NUMBER results</span><span id=few_results> $NUMBER results</span></div><div id=results role=listbox></div></div></div></div></footer>
